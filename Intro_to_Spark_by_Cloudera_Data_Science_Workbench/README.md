## Intro to Spark

This project is designed to be a gentle introduction to Spark using
the Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW). 

Interact with this project by importing into CDSW and running each setion in
your CDSW console. Section0 provides some instrutions on setting up the 
data sources that are used for the rest of the examples. With a few exceptions, 
this will deal with all the pre-reqs needed for the sections to follow. 

Let me know if you have any feedback!
