      "Recently, machine learning has achieved remarkable results in systems that classify objects in images. The biggest recent advancement came from the AlexNet architecure (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012), a huge convolutional neural network that is initially designed by LeCun at 1989, won 2012 ImageNet competition by making %40 less errors than the next best competitor. In the next years, almost all participants implemented AlexNet inspired deep neural networks and currently the models we have are quite comparable to human-level performance (Russakovsky et al., 2014).\n",

However, due to the saturating non-linearity of these functions, it takes a lot of time to train them. The non-linearity that comes with the ReLUs were good enough, but most importantly they were much faster than tanh or sigmoid. This enabled to run such a large (at that time) neural network. \n",

So every time a new input comes, the network develops a different architecture. These different architectures have the same weights, though. This technique prevents units from co-adapting (since a neuron cannot rely on the presence of particular other neurons) too much. Therefore, the neurons are forced to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons. \n",
