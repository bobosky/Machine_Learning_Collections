/* 
 We've looked at a few examples of different storage layers that
 Spark can work with. There are lots of others available, as well. 

 Some of these are native to Spark (like Hbase), whereas others require
 additional libraries (like MongoDB, Cassandra, Elastic Search, etc.). 
 You can often find open source libararies on github or Spark Packages: https://spark-packages.org/?q=tags%3A%22Data%20Sources%22
