# Machine Learning Algorithm/Coding Test Repository
Sample test data are [published at UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/).

## Python Packages to install
* Some nice [list of Python packages](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) for Python coding. Another its link is [here](http://awesome-python.com/).
* Standard Python packages include `pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn`
* H2O for R and Python
    * For Python version, download the [whl file](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/h2o/) and pip install the file. Basic introduction to its useage is [here](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-dev/master/1072/docs-website/h2o-py/docs/index.html).
* Other useful packages include
    * `seaborn` for data visualization.
    * `Orange` for graphic modeling instead of source coding.
    * `Theano` for deep learning and tensor calculation.
    * `numba` for JIT (just-in-time compilation) when it involves (especially looping) many generic Python codes and numpy.
